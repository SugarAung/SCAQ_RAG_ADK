  {
    "Verb": "Arrange",

In addition, it is important that you also mention any other relevant factors (eg the ethical and legal issues)."
  },
  {
    "Verb": "Evaluate",
    "Description": "Pass judgment on or provide your opinion based on the facts at hand.  When making an evaluation, there are often predetermined criteria that you will use to base your opinion on.

  },
  {
    "Verb": null,

For instance, 'Identify the Board Matters …' is asking you to focus solely on issues that relate to Board Matters from the Singapore Code of Corporate Governance, so if you digress and identify remuneration issues, you will not score well. Another example is 'Identify the companies that qualify as members of a group for the purposes of group tax relief'.
